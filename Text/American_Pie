American Pie

A long long time ago
I can still remember how that music used to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while

But February made me shiver
With every paper I'd deliver
Bad news on the door step
I couldn't take one more step

I can't remember if I cried
When I read about his widowed bride
But something touched me deep inside
The day the music died

So bye bye miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levy but the levy was dry
Them good ol' boys were drinking whisky and rye
Singing "This'll be the day that I die."
This'll be the day that I die
